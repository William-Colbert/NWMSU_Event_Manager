# NWMSU_Event_Manager
The project is a NWMSU Event Manager application that allows students to view events created by administrators and add them to their personal calendar in the application. Each student will have their own account with their own credentials for security and authentication. A student can only view their own calendar. Administrators can add events to a list of events or a grand calendar containing all events, so that students can choose from it to add events to their own calendar. Administrators can remove or edit the details of the events. Students can view the details of events, but they cannot edit them. Administrators cannot view a studentâ€™s calendar. Administrators can also see all events and their details. After an event has passed, students can give a review of the event and administrators can view the reviews.
